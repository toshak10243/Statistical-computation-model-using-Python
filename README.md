# Statistical Computation Model using Python  

## 📌 Description  
This project is a **Statistical Computation Model** implemented in Python. It calculates various statistical measures such as:  
✔ Mean, Median, Mode  
✔ Range, Variance, Standard Deviation  
✔ Covariance, Correlation, Coefficient of Variation  

## 🚀 Why Use This Model?  
🔹 Useful for basic **data analysis** and **statistical calculations**  
🔹 Helps in **understanding relationships** between datasets  
🔹 Simple, easy-to-use, and implemented in **Python**  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- NumPy 📊  
- SciPy 🔢  

Install dependencies:

pip install numpy scipy

Run the script 
copy the code and run in any python compiler.


 Notes
✅ This is NOT an AI Model. It does not learn from data but only computes statistical metrics.
✅ If you want to convert it into an AI model, you can add Machine Learning capabilities like regression, clustering, or neural networks.
